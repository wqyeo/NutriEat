# NutriEat

**NutriEat** is a platformer game about healthy eating. The game aims to promote healthy eating, targetted towards children. This game is powered by **EatEngine**

# EatEngine

This game engine depends on LibGDX to render graphics and handle physics.

The EatEngine is developed on the principle of _"You Define, We Execute"_. This allows a developer to just simply create and define objects, and the engine will handle the functionality of the object.

Adopting a component-based design, EatEngine makes game development easy by allowing developers to create game-objects, then define their functionality by attaching components.

### Using the engine

## Sample Scene

The sample scene contains a awkardly drawn main menu, and a random platforming entity.

The sample scene showcases the engine's capability to switch between Scenes _(Main Menu and Platforming Level)_, and how it handles the lifecycle for a developer.
